# Airlines Dataset Analysis Model

## Overview
This project outlines the models and methodologies employed in the analysis of the Airlines Dataset. The analysis involves a combination of Python and SQL to extract insights, optimize operations, and enhance the overall efficiency of the airline.

### Python
1. **Pandas for Data Manipulation:** Utilized Pandas for cleaning, transforming, and structuring the dataset, ensuring it is ready for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations to understand data distributions, relationships, and identify patterns.

### SQL
1. **Data Extraction:** Leveraged SQL queries to extract relevant data from the database tables, ensuring a streamlined and efficient data retrieval process.
2. **Data Cleansing:** Employed SQL to clean and preprocess data within the database, addressing any anomalies or inconsistencies.

## Conclusion
This model outlines the methodologies, tools, and libraries used in the analysis of the Airlines Dataset. The combined use of Python and SQL has facilitated a comprehensive exploration of operational data, passenger behavior, revenue trends, and the generation of actionable insights for enhanced decision-making within the airline industry.
